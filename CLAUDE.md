# Heft

Native macOS markdown vault editor (Bear/Obsidian alternative). Pure Swift, plain
Swift Package Manager, no Xcode project, macOS 26 target. Sync is just pointing the
vault folder at iCloud Drive; there is no custom sync engine. Opens an existing
Obsidian vault unmodified, including its `.obsidian/` config.

```bash
swift build                                     # compile
Scripts/bundle.sh debug                         # assemble .build/Heft.app (dock icon + menu bar)
Scripts/install.sh [--launch]                   # release build into /Applications
swift test                                      # core and disposable-vault integration checks
swift run Heft stats <vault>                    # read-only index report; safe on the real vault
swift run Heft render <vault> <note> [caret]    # what the live surface would draw, headless
swift run Heft daily <vault> [YYYY-MM-DD]       # template expansion without the GUI
```

## Architecture

Two targets:

- `HeftCore`: pure logic. Never imports AppKit or SwiftUI. Parsing, the link index,
  the vault scanner, moment.js date formatting, live-mode decorations.
- `Heft`: the macOS shell. SwiftUI chrome around an `NSTextView`.

The dependencies are Apple's swift-markdown (cmark-gfm), SwiftMath (LaTeX), and
swift-markdown-engine for its syntax-highlighting grammars.

Vault-wide scanning, indexing, settings, recents, and file watching live in a
shared `VaultSession`. Each window owns a separate `AppModel` for its open note,
navigation, folder focus, and visible panels. A focused folder scopes browsing
and search without turning that folder into another vault; multiple windows can
therefore show different parts of one vault without duplicate watchers or indexes.

### The editing surface

One Obsidian-style live surface, not source/split/preview. `LiveTextEditor` is a
single TextKit 2 buffer.

Markup is hidden by **collapsing** it: the characters stay in the text storage and
keep their place in every offset, but get a hairline font and a clear colour. The
buffer therefore always equals the file byte-for-byte, and selecting across hidden
markup copies real source. Nothing is ever rewritten to make it render.

Anything no text attribute can express (tables, LaTeX, image embeds, note
transclusions, frontmatter properties, quote and callout cards, list bullets,
checkboxes, heading rules, thematic breaks) is collapsed and then painted by the
`NSTextLayoutFragment` subclass in `LiveWidgets.swift`. That subclassability is the
whole reason the editor is on TextKit 2 rather than 1.

Markup comes back at two different granularities, which is most of what makes the
surface feel like Obsidian: block markup (heading hashes, list and quote markers,
fences, tables) reveals when the caret is anywhere on its line, while inline spans
(`**bold**`, `$math$`, links) reveal only when the caret is inside that span. The
policy lives in `Reveal` in HeftCore, so it is covered by the test suite.

Three files carry it:

- `LiveDecorator` (in HeftCore): what to style and where. Pure, testable.
- `LiveStyler`: turns decorations into attributes, and decides which widgets to draw.
- `LiveWidgets`: measures tables and draws every widget.

## Gotchas, all of them hard-won

- **Xcode 26.6 is installed, but `xcode-select` points at the Command Line Tools.**
  So `xcodebuild`, `actool` and friends fail with "requires Xcode" until
  `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` is set — which
  `Scripts/bundle.sh` does for itself rather than changing the machine globally.
  Tests live in `Tests/HeftTests` and therefore also need that `DEVELOPER_DIR`
  when the selected Command Line Tools and installed SDK do not match.
- **A dynamic system colour resolves the moment you call `withAlphaComponent`,**
  using whatever appearance is current then — not the one you are drawing in.
  `quaternarySystemFill.withAlphaComponent(0.6)` painted a near-white slab
  behind dark-mode blockquotes. Use such colours as they come, or resolve them
  explicitly through `RenderContext.resolved(_:)`.
- **`paragraphSpacingBefore` lands inside the layout fragment; `paragraphSpacing`
  does not.** So a block drawn across several paragraphs gets its top padding
  for free and has to paint its bottom padding into the reserved gap below,
  extending `renderingSurfaceBounds` to match.
- **Never point the GUI at the real vault while testing.** It autosaves. Use a copied
  sandbox vault, or the read-only `stats` and `render` commands.
- **Obsidian templates use moment.js tokens, which collide with ICU.** moment `DD` is
  day-of-month but ICU `DD` is day-of-year; moment `WW` is the ISO week but ICU `WW`
  is week-of-month; moment escapes with `[W]` where ICU uses `'W'`. `MomentFormat`
  implements them directly. Never route these through `DateFormatter`.
- **Reserve widget height with `minimumLineHeight`, not by overriding
  `layoutFragmentFrame`.** Line height is ordinary paragraph geometry the layout
  manager must honour; the frame override did not survive contact with reality and
  the widgets rendered as hairlines.
- **Lay the document out eagerly** (`ensureLayout`) after every restyle. TextKit 2
  estimates the height of regions it has not reached, assuming ordinary lines. This
  editor's fragments are nothing like ordinary (a six-line table is one 148pt
  fragment plus five hairlines), so the estimate is far enough out that clicking
  makes the document resize, sliding text under the pointer and turning a click into
  a drag-selection.
- **Never mutate text attributes while the mouse is tracking.** `super.mouseDown`
  runs its own event loop until the button comes up and posts selection changes from
  inside it. Restyling there rewrites what the loop is hit-testing against, landing
  the caret on the wrong character. Restyles are queued and applied on mouse-up.
- **`NSColor.cgColor` resolves against `NSAppearance.current`, which is not set
  during fragment drawing.** Wrap widget drawing in
  `appearance.performAsCurrentDrawingAppearance`, or gutter glyphs get the light
  palette and vanish on a dark background.
- **`NSImage.draw` needs `respectFlipped: true`** in a text container, or images and
  formulae come out mirrored.
- **Protection in `LiveDecorator` rejects any candidate that *intersects* a protected
  range.** So block constructs must be collected before inline spans are protected,
  or `# The $h(t)$ model` loses its heading entirely instead of nesting.
- **Calendar visibility belongs in the View menu, not the window toolbar.** The
  `Show Calendar` command also has the `⇧⌘D` shortcut. Leave the system-provided
  `NavigationSplitView` sidebar toggle untouched.
- **Real-vault syntax that breaks naive parsers:** Obsidian writes `\|` for a literal
  pipe inside tables (`![[chart.png\|500]]`), and brackets can abut links
  (`\[[[Paper Name]]`), where the link is the innermost pair.

## Known gaps

- Embed display widths are ignored: `![[img.png|700]]` renders at natural size,
  capped at 460pt.
- A transcluded note is styled but gets no widgets of its own, so a table or
  picture inside an embed shows as source. This is also the recursion guard.
- An embedded note is clipped at 420pt and faded, because a layout fragment
  cannot scroll.
- Lists and headings inside a `>` block are not detected: the block matchers are
  anchored to the start of the line, so `> - item` is quoted text, not a list.
- Callout folding (`[!note]-`) parses and hides the marker but does not fold.
- Renaming a *folder* does not repoint path-shaped links into it; renaming a
  note does.
- Native tabbing is not customized; workspace windows are independent windows.
- Deferred: Vim editing (the plan is embedding real Neovim via VimR's `NvimView`,
  not reimplementing modal editing), graph view, plugins, settings UI.

## The icon

`Resources/Heft.icon` is a layered macOS 26 icon, compiled by `actool` during
bundling into `Assets.car` plus an `.icns` fallback. Its format is undocumented
and was reverse engineered; see `Resources/Heft.icon/README.md` before editing.

## Decisions already made

Kotlin Multiplatform was evaluated and rejected: the only portable slice is the
parser and link index, which is not worth the Gradle/SKIE boundary, and iOS is the
next target and is Swift anyway. See the `Apude` repo for what that boundary costs.

A web-based renderer was rejected outright. This is a native app.
